## API representation Languages

* [ALPS Specification documents](https://github.com/alps-io/spec)
* [JSON Schema spec](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html)
* [JSON Schema documentation generation tool](https://github.com/interagent/prmd)
* [Postman Collections internal format](http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/09/postman-collections-will-take-your-api-productivity-to-the-next-level/)

* [API Blueprint - Apiary.io’s API definition language designed to allow anyone, not just developers to design APIs](http://apiblueprint.org/)

## API Design Tooling
### swagger

* [Swagger CodeGen - A template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing a Swagger Core definition](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
* [Swagger UI - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger defined API](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
* [Swagger JS - Javascript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or nodejs](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js)
* [Swagger Node Express - Swagger module for node.js w/express module](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-node-express)
* [Swagger Socket - A REST over WebSocket](https://github.com/wordnik/swaggersocket)
* [Swagger Play 2 - Provides automatically-generated Swagger JSON for the Play! framework](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-play-1.2)

### RAML
* [RAML JavaScript Parser - A reference implementation of a RAML parser for JavaScript. It's based on PyYAML, written in CoffeeScript, and can be used as a node.js module or in-browser. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license. ](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser)
* [RAML Java Parser - A reference implementation of a RAML parser for Java. It's based on SnakeYAML, and written in Java. It can be added as a Java library into a project directly or through Apache Maven. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser)
* [API Designer - A web-based API development tool that allows API providers to design their API quickly, efficiently, and consistently, and socialize the design. It consists of a RAML editor side-by-side with an embedded RAML console (the API Console). It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.  ]()
* [API Console - A graphical user interface for a RAML-defined API that visually exposes the API’s structure and important patterns and serves as interactive API documentation. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.  ]()
* [API Notebook - A web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs, and saving API use cases as markdown gists, so they are versioned, forkable and shareable. It's an example of literate programming. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.]()
* [SoapUI RAML Plugin - SoapUI is a very popular functional testing tool, broadly used for testing APIs. It supports not only SOAP but also REST and any other HTTP APIs, as well as JMS, AMF and JDBC. The RAML plugin for SoapUI allows importing RAML descriptions of APIs into SoapUI to test those APIs. The plugin is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.  ]()
* [APIkit - A declarative toolkit that leverages RAML to facilitate the implementation of APIs. It uses RAML as the definition of the API, which can then be used with APIkit Maven- and Mule Studio-based tools for mocking the interface and implementing its backend using Mule flows. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license. ]()
* [RAML Store - A simple storage API plus a persistence plugin which enables you to run the RAML API Designer locally (rather than using a cloud service) and still be able to manage and collaborate on your design. The service is built with node.js, using express and mongodb.  ]()
* [JAX-RS Codegen - A set of Java tools that support an API-first approach to implementing RAML-described RESTful services in Java with JAX-RS. Given a RAML specification of an API, it generates corresponding JAX-RS-annotated interfaces and supporting classes, which can be used in your project to implement those spec-compliant APIs. This project is in early alpha. It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.]()
* [RAML Sublime Plugin - This is a simple syntax highlighter for Sublime that provides support for the RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/). It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.]()

### API-Blueprint

* [Snowcrash - The API Blueprint parser built on top of the Sundown Markdown parser](https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash)
* [Apiary.io - Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing]()
* [Server Mock - Providing a mock API interface allowing you to experiment with an API interface before you write any code]()
* [Interactive Documentation - Auto generated API documentation that allows developers to authenticate and make live calls to an API while learning the documentation]()
* [GitHub Sync - Apiary uses Github to store each API Blueprint, allowing it to be stored publicly or privately on Github, with automatic updating of API docs with each Github commit]()
* [Command Line Tools - A separate command-line interface available as ruby gem, allowing for the automation and integration of API Blueprints it your regular workflow]()
* [Traffic Inspector - Providing a proxy to run API calls through allowing the breakdown of each call to APIs, helping developers understand and debug APIs much easier]()
* [Discussion - Communication tools within API blueprint documentation allowing team and public developer conversations]()
* [HTTP Call Validator - Gavel is a tool for deciding which HTTP API call is valid and which is not](https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel)
* [API Blueprint Testing Tool - Dredd is a command-line tool for testing API documentation written in API Blueprint format against its backend implementation.](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd)
